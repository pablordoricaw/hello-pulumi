# Hello Pulumi

This repository uses the [Get started with Pulumi & Google Cloud](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/get-started/gcp/) tutorial to investigate how to deploy infrastructure to GCP in an automated fashion from a GitHub repository.

## Setup

This section describes the setup across all platforms and tools.

### Pulumi Cloud

I have a personal Pulumi Cloud account not an organization. In all the sections below my personal account was used instead of an orgaccount.

### Configure OpenID Connect Between Pulumi Cloud and GitHub

Followed the Pulumi docs on [Configuring OpenID Connect for Github](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/pulumi-cloud/access-management/oidc/client/github/) to configure OIDC betwwen Pulumi Cloud and GitHub.
